            <p>The smallest cat breed in the world, the Singapura may be half the size of the average cat (as little as 4 pounds!) but he has a big presence. This tiny breed is active and affectionate and wants to know what everybody's doing all the time. The friendly breed is ideal for families with kids and other pets because the last thing the Singapura wants is to be left alone.</p>
